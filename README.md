## How to contribute by adding a new example page

1. Create a dart file under `lib/route/` (or just duplicate a file, e.g. `cp widgets_icon_ex.dart new_example.dart`);
2. In the new file, create a class that extends MyRoute;
3. Add  constructor, the convention is to use the file path as constructor's default parameter;
4. (Optional) override getters: `title`, `description`, `links`;
5. Override `buildMyRouteContent()`, try to make the code simple, as it'll be shown on phone screens;
6. Open `lib/my_app_meta.dart`, import the new file at the beginning of file;
7. In `kMyAppRoutesStructure`, add an instantiation of the new class under the appropriate item group.
